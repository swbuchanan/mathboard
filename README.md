## Motivation
This is a modification of a The Real Programmer's Dvorak optimized slightly for my own personal uses, which involve writing both for programming and for mathemattics.

## Why Dvorak?
Dvorak comes on evey major OS.

## Why change programmers Dvorak?
The major problems around PD is that it has a poorly thought out symbol layout.

## Why change the real programmer's Dvorak?
The major problems around RPD is that it wasn't designed for me personally.

* (, ), {, }, [, ]
** The opening and closing symbols are oddly placed.  It makes so much more sense that finger used to open is the same finger on the closing hand.
