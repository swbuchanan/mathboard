I'm not very good at windows but I think to install the keyboard layout on windows you just need to go into the mdvorak folder and run the installer that's appropriate for your computer.
I had to restart my computer before it started working properly as well.
If installing a program where you can't see the source code isn't your thing, you can create your own installer, as mentioned in the final paragraph.

At the moment capslock is not working properly, so if you care about that then TOO BAD.

The installer was generated using Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator 1.4, which you can download (or the latest version of it at any rate) from Microsoft.
I haven't done any testing on other keyboards, but if yours is weird then I bet my layout won't work properly.
If this is the case, the easiest thing to do may be to make your own version.
Using the MKLC, you can load mathboard.klc file and make your own changes and then create your own installer.
